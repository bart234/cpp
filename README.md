# cpp
Short about me:
I learn c++ for 4y, with more and less intense moments after daily work. I dont remember what book/course was first. At begining I bougth course on udemy Begining C++ Programming - From Begginer to Beyond, it contain 40h of movies, so it took me almost 4 months to watch and get process that knowledge and exercises (most of that is in folderf 09xx). Also I attend on C++ NOKIA Academy XVII in Wroclaw in 2021. I resigned before last test when they told "We will not explain design patterns, you can google" - so i did. Main purpose of that course wasnt a job, but to get structured knowledge and i got it. They covered a lot topiks which i heard first time. After that I was exhausted and spent the next few months trying to understand the SFML libraries (simple framework for making game),learned a lot about application loop, game background and game development - still one book and one online project is waiting for free time. Last year was quite intense in c++ learning. I started exploring linux - so i learned bash - also i focused on existing books and courses (ofcourse during learning i found new topicks). For last few months i made topicks like: bash(simple one, im not admin type), usage bash by c++, in c++ i started multthreading topic - only in lunux, i focus on older functions and little scratch C++20 stuff. Currently im reading C++ Programming for Linux Systems to learn linux processes, threads manipulation, signalisations and communication. 
Books and coures ( from last 2-3 y):
- Linux fundamentals - oreilly course (done) - it cover linux commands  and some bash stuff
- Linux for Developers: Jumpstart Your Linux Programming Skills - (done 10%) - have to wait
- Building Low Latency Applicaiton with C++ - extreamly hard, (done 15%), out of my skills for that time, theory was awsome but prctice ahve to wait
- How Linux Works - oreailly couse (20% done) - first 3 chaprets was awsome, rest is for admins 
- Professional C++, 5th Edition - huge one, (20% done-in progress), readed mostly for topicks which i read offline
- Design Patterns - still in progress (50% done-in progress) - eg in java, each dp I trying to rewwite into c++
- C++ Programming for Linux Systems  - still in progress (80% done-in progress), focused on POSIX, hard to process but almost done  

Repository info: 
Each folder contain some descriptions about each project inside. Projects folders contain my own projects. 
Other folders have many things divided by topicks, like processed egzaples from books and courses very often developed in some way and tested in another way. I dont store here clean codes ones copied from other sources, all that code was wrote by me (in hard topicks 1:1) with comments and my stiupid errors.

I have a lot smaller or bigger files and projects, i will adjust it and clean but it is process, because that all files ale from many years.
