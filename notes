pthread
it use as funciton - pointer or ref
it took one argument  for that function
if you want to add more - make struct for them
you pass ref to structure and in funciton it land as void pointer
you need to recast it to correct pointer 

void* f_to_sum_part_of_arr3(void *arg)
{             
    int temp{};
    struct my_args2 *my_temp_struct;
    my_temp_struct =(my_args2*)arg;
