hard link is like smart pointer 
- creation: ls -ln <my_sourcefile> <my output file>
- has a occurance counter
- using ls -li: it point to same part of memory
- cannot link PATHS ON DIFFRENT PARTITIONS

soft link - symbolic link
- creation: ls -s  <my_sourcefile> <my output file>
- somehting like shortcut in windows - you can delete it but file remain
- has it own permissions, and point in diffrent place at memory
- it reffering to path name, not to file itself
- can point ACROSS PARTITIONS
- we can delete source file, and symlink will be still exist
