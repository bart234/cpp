lazy initializaiton -  metod to postpone  object contruction to  time when it it really needed

-speed up code
-save systme resources

minus: - object can be not fully created when it will be necesseary

int type - usually should be use as pass-by-value
other types - by ref - becasue copy ot if , and their constructor is hevier
